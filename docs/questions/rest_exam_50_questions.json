                    "question": "What is REST and who introduced it?",
                    "answer": "REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems, first introduced by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation."

                    "question": "List the six guiding constraints of REST.",
                    "answer": "1. Client-Server\n2. Stateless\n3. Cacheable\n4. Uniform Interface\n5. Layered System\n6. Code on Demand (optional)"

                    "id": 3,
                    "question": "Explain the 'Stateless' constraint in REST.",
                    "answer": "Stateless means that each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client."
                },
                {
                    "id": 4,
                    "question": "What is a 'Resource' in REST?",
                    "answer": "A resource is the key abstraction of information in REST. It can be any entity (document, image, temporal service, collection of other resources) that can be named and addressed via a URI."
                },
                {
                    "id": 5,
                    "question": "What is the 'Uniform Interface' constraint?",
                    "answer": "It simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently. The four guiding principles are: Resource-Based, Manipulation of Resources Through Representations, Self-descriptive Messages, and HATEOAS."
                },

                    "id": 6,
                    "question": "What is 'Layered System' in REST architecture?",
                    "answer": "A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way. Intermediary servers may improve system scalability by enabling load balancing and by providing shared caches."
                },
                {
                    "id": 7,
                    "question": "Explain 'Code on Demand'.",
                    "answer": "Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring executable code (e.g., scripts like JavaScript). This is the only optional constraint in REST."

                    "id": 8,
                    "question": "What is a 'Representation' of a resource?",
                    "answer": "A representation is a snapshot of the resource state at a given time (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML). The client interacts with the resource state through these representations."

                    "question": "What are the primary HTTP methods used in REST?",
                    "answer": "GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update/replace), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove), OPTIONS (capabilities), HEAD (headers only)."
                },

                    "question": "What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?",
                    "answer": "PUT is used to replace a resource entirely (or create if not exists). PATCH is used to apply partial modifications to a resource."
                },

                    "id": 11,
                    "question": "Explain the concept of Idempotency in HTTP methods.",
                    "answer": "An idempotent method is one that can be called multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS are idempotent. POST is NOT idempotent."
                },
                {
                    "id": 12,
                    "question": "Is DELETE idempotent? Why?",
                    "answer": "Yes. Calling DELETE on a resource once removes it. Calling it again returns 404 (or 200/204), but the state of the server remains the same (the resource is gone)."

                    "id": 13,
                    "question": "When should you use POST vs PUT?",
                    "answer": "Use POST when you want the server to control the URL generation (creating a subordinate resource). Use PUT when the client specifies the exact URL of the resource to be created or updated."
                },
                {
                    "id": 14,

                    "answer": "The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created."

                    "id": 15,
                    "question": "What is the difference between 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden?",
                    "answer": "401 means 'Unauthenticated' (the user is not logged in or credentials are bad). 403 means 'Unauthorized' (the user is logged in but lacks permission to access the resource)."
                },
                {
                    "id": 16,
                    "question": "What does 204 No Content mean?",
                    "answer": "The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content. Commonly used for DELETE or PUT requests."

                    "id": 17,
                    "question": "What is the purpose of the OPTIONS method?",
                    "answer": "It allows a client to request information about the communication options available for the target resource (e.g., checking CORS permissions)."

                    "id": 19,
                    "question": "What does 405 Method Not Allowed indicate?",
                    "answer": "The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource (e.g., trying to DELETE a resource that is read-only)."

                    "answer": "Use nouns, not verbs (e.g., /users, not /getUsers). Use plural nouns for collections. Use hyphens for readability. Use lowercase letters."

                    "answer": "Use query parameters like ?page=2&limit=20 or ?offset=10&limit=10. The response should ideally include metadata about total records and links to next/prev pages."
