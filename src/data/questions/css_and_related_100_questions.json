      "title": "Core Concepts (Cascade, Specificity, Box Model)",
      "questions": [
        { "id": 1, "question": "What is the CSS cascade?", "answer": "The set of rules CSS uses to resolve conflicts between declarations: importance (!important), origin (user/author/UA), specificity, and source order." },
        { "id": 2, "question": "How is selector specificity typically ranked?", "answer": "Inline styles > IDs > classes/attributes/pseudo-classes > elements/pseudo-elements." },
        { "id": 3, "question": "Does !important always win?", "answer": "It wins within the same origin/importance level; conflicts between !important rules are still resolved by specificity and source order." },
        { "id": 4, "question": "What is inheritance in CSS?", "answer": "Some properties (like color and font) inherit from parent to child; others (like margin) do not." },
        { "id": 5, "question": "What is the initial value of a CSS property?", "answer": "The default value defined by CSS specs when no other value applies." },
        { "id": 6, "question": "What does box-sizing: content-box mean?", "answer": "Width/height apply to the content only; padding and border add to the final rendered size." },
        { "id": 7, "question": "What does box-sizing: border-box mean?", "answer": "Width/height include padding and border, making layout sizing more predictable." },
        { "id": 8, "question": "How do margin collapsing rules work (in simple terms)?", "answer": "Vertical margins between block elements can collapse into a single margin (usually the larger one)." },
        { "id": 9, "question": "What’s the difference between a block and an inline element?", "answer": "Block elements start on a new line and can have width/height; inline elements flow in text and ignore width/height by default." },
        { "id": 10, "question": "What does display: inline-block do?", "answer": "It flows inline like text but supports width/height like a block." },
        { "id": 11, "question": "What is the difference between visibility: hidden and opacity: 0?", "answer": "Both hide visually, but visibility:hidden prevents interaction while opacity:0 can still be clickable unless pointer-events is changed." },
        { "id": 12, "question": "What does pointer-events: none do?", "answer": "Prevents the element from receiving mouse/pointer interactions." },
        { "id": 13, "question": "What does the universal selector (*) select?", "answer": "All elements." },
        { "id": 14, "question": "What are attribute selectors used for?", "answer": "To target elements based on attributes (e.g., input[type='email'])." },
        { "id": 15, "question": "What is the difference between :nth-child and :nth-of-type?", "answer": ":nth-child counts all children; :nth-of-type counts only siblings of the same element type." },
        { "id": 16, "question": "What is the difference between ::before and :before?", "answer": "They are equivalent in most browsers, but ::before is the modern pseudo-element syntax." },
        { "id": 17, "question": "When does z-index apply?", "answer": "Primarily on positioned elements (or flex/grid items in certain cases) within a stacking context." },
        { "id": 18, "question": "What creates a new stacking context?", "answer": "Examples: position with z-index, opacity < 1, transform, filter, isolation:isolate, and others." },
        { "id": 19, "question": "What is the difference between rem and em?", "answer": "rem is relative to the root font-size; em is relative to the element’s computed font-size (often the parent)." },
        { "id": 20, "question": "What’s a common reason to prefer rem for spacing?", "answer": "It scales consistently with user font-size settings and avoids compounding in nested elements." }

      "title": "Layout: Flexbox, Grid, Positioning",
      "questions": [
        { "id": 21, "question": "What is the main axis in flexbox?", "answer": "The axis along which flex items are laid out; it’s controlled by flex-direction." },
        { "id": 22, "question": "What is the cross axis in flexbox?", "answer": "The axis perpendicular to the main axis." },
        { "id": 23, "question": "What does justify-content control in a flex container?", "answer": "Distribution and alignment of items along the main axis." },

        { "id": 25, "question": "What does align-self do?", "answer": "Overrides align-items for a single flex/grid item." },
        { "id": 26, "question": "What does flex: 1 mean?", "answer": "Shorthand for flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0% (commonly), allowing the item to grow and share remaining space." },
        { "id": 27, "question": "What does flex-basis control?", "answer": "The initial main-size of a flex item before free space is distributed." },
        { "id": 28, "question": "What problem does gap solve in flex/grid layouts?", "answer": "It creates consistent spacing between items without needing margins and avoiding edge-case math." },
        { "id": 29, "question": "How do you create a two-column layout with CSS Grid?", "answer": "Use display:grid and grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr (or other fractions)." },
        { "id": 30, "question": "What is the difference between auto-fill and auto-fit in CSS Grid?", "answer": "Both repeat tracks, but auto-fit collapses empty tracks to fit content, while auto-fill keeps the track slots reserved." },
        { "id": 31, "question": "What is an implicit grid?", "answer": "Grid tracks created automatically when items are placed outside the explicit grid defined by grid-template-rows/columns." },
        { "id": 32, "question": "What’s the difference between position: relative and position: absolute?", "answer": "relative offsets the element from its normal position; absolute removes it from flow and positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor." },
        { "id": 33, "question": "What does position: sticky do?", "answer": "It behaves like relative until a scroll threshold, then sticks like fixed within its scroll container." },
        { "id": 34, "question": "How do you center an element horizontally with margin?", "answer": "Give it a width and use margin-left/right: auto (e.g., margin: 0 auto)." },
        { "id": 35, "question": "How do you avoid layout shift when loading images?", "answer": "Reserve space using width/height or an aspect-ratio box, so the page doesn’t reflow." },
        { "id": 36, "question": "What does aspect-ratio do?", "answer": "Provides an intrinsic ratio used for sizing, often to maintain consistent boxes." },
        { "id": 37, "question": "What is a containing block?", "answer": "The reference box used for percentage-based sizing and for positioning absolutely positioned elements." },
        { "id": 38, "question": "What does overflow: auto do?", "answer": "Adds scrollbars only when content overflows." },
        { "id": 39, "question": "What is the difference between overflow-x and overflow-y?", "answer": "They control overflow behavior independently on the horizontal and vertical axes." },
        { "id": 40, "question": "What is a common cause of “flex items not shrinking”?", "answer": "Items can overflow because min-width defaults to auto; setting min-width: 0 on children often fixes it." }

      "title": "Responsive Design & Media Queries",
      "questions": [
        { "id": 41, "question": "What is a media query?", "answer": "A CSS technique to apply styles based on device/viewport characteristics like width, resolution, or prefers-color-scheme." },
        { "id": 42, "question": "What is mobile-first CSS?", "answer": "Write base styles for small screens first, then use min-width media queries to enhance for larger screens." },
        { "id": 43, "question": "What does @media (min-width: 768px) mean?", "answer": "Apply the enclosed styles when the viewport width is at least 768px." },
        { "id": 44, "question": "What is the difference between px and viewport units (vw/vh)?", "answer": "px is fixed; vw/vh are relative to the viewport dimensions." },
        { "id": 45, "question": "What are container queries (high level)?", "answer": "They let styles respond to the size of a container rather than the viewport." },
        { "id": 46, "question": "Why are rem units helpful for accessibility?", "answer": "They respect user font scaling, making layouts and typography easier to enlarge." },
        { "id": 47, "question": "What is prefers-reduced-motion used for?", "answer": "To reduce or disable animations/transitions for users who request less motion." },
        { "id": 48, "question": "What is prefers-color-scheme used for?", "answer": "To apply light/dark theme styles based on the user’s OS setting." },
        { "id": 49, "question": "What does max-width: 100% on images do?", "answer": "Prevents images from overflowing their containers on smaller screens." },
        { "id": 50, "question": "What is the difference between min(), max(), and clamp()?", "answer": "They compute dynamic values: min picks the smallest, max picks the largest, clamp clamps between a min and max with a preferred value." },
        { "id": 51, "question": "Give an example of clamp() usage.", "answer": "Responsive font size like font-size: clamp(1rem, 2vw + 0.5rem, 2rem)." },
        { "id": 52, "question": "What is a breakpoint?", "answer": "A viewport (or container) size at which layout or styling changes for better usability." },
        { "id": 53, "question": "What is the viewport meta tag used for?", "answer": "On mobile, it controls layout viewport scaling; without it, responsive CSS can behave unexpectedly." },
        { "id": 54, "question": "What is a fluid layout?", "answer": "A layout that adapts smoothly using relative units instead of fixed pixel widths." },
        { "id": 55, "question": "What is the difference between responsive and adaptive design?", "answer": "Responsive continuously adapts; adaptive switches between discrete layouts at breakpoints." }

        { "id": 57, "question": "What is the difference between font-weight: 400 and 700?", "answer": "400 is normal weight; 700 is bold (assuming the font has those weights)." },
        { "id": 58, "question": "What is a web-safe font?", "answer": "A font likely installed on most systems (e.g., Arial), reducing dependency on downloads." },
        { "id": 59, "question": "What is the difference between hex and rgb colors?", "answer": "Both represent colors; hex is base-16 notation (#RRGGBB) and rgb is functional notation (rgb(r,g,b))." },
        { "id": 60, "question": "What is HSL and why use it?", "answer": "Hue/Saturation/Lightness; it’s often easier to tweak theme colors by adjusting lightness or saturation." },
