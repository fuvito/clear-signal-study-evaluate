                    "question": "What is the CAP Theorem?",
                    "answer": "The CAP theorem states that a distributed data store can only provide two of the following three guarantees: Consistency (every read receives the most recent write or an error), Availability (every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write), and Partition Tolerance (the system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped or delayed by the network)."

                    "id": 2,
                    "question": "Explain the difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.",
                    "answer": "Vertical scaling (scaling up) means adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. Horizontal scaling (scaling out) means adding more machines to a pool of resources. Horizontal scaling is generally more preferred for distributed systems as it offers better redundancy and theoretically infinite scaling."
                },

                    "question": "What is Loose Coupling?",
                    "answer": "Loose coupling is a design goal where components of a system have little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components. It reduces dependencies, making the system easier to modify, test, and maintain."

                    "question": "Define 'High Cohesion'.",
                    "answer": "High cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together. A highly cohesive module performs a specific task or a set of related tasks, making the code more understandable and maintainable."

                    "id": 5,
                    "question": "What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?",
                    "answer": "SRP states that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. It implies that a class should have only one job or responsibility."

                    "question": "Explain the concept of 'Idempotency'.",
                    "answer": "An operation is idempotent if it can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. This is crucial in distributed systems and APIs to handle retries safely."

                    "answer": "ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps."

                    "answer": "BASE stands for Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency. It is an alternative to ACID used in NoSQL databases, prioritizing availability and partition tolerance over immediate consistency."

                    "answer": "Also known as the principle of least knowledge, it states that a module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates. Specifically, an object should only talk to its immediate friends."

                    "question": "Explain the Open/Closed Principle.",
                    "answer": "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows behavior to be added without changing existing code."

                    "answer": "Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value."

                    "answer": "Sharding is a database partitioning pattern where data is split horizontally across multiple databases or instances to spread the load and allow for storage beyond the capacity of a single server."

                    "answer": "Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing scheme that operates independently of the number of servers or objects in a distributed hash table. It allows scaling nodes up and down with minimal remapping of keys."
                },

                    "answer": "Split-brain is a condition in a distributed system where the network between nodes is severed, causing two or more sets of nodes to believe they are the primary or authoritative set, potentially leading to data corruption or inconsistency."

                    "id": 16,
                    "question": "What is Service Discovery?",
                    "answer": "Service discovery is the process of automatically detecting devices and services on a network. In microservices, it allows services to find the network location (IP and port) of other services dynamically."

                    "answer": "The Saga pattern is a failure management pattern that helps establish consistency in distributed applications. It manages transactions that span multiple services by a sequence of local transactions, where each updates data within a single service."

                    "answer": "2PC is a standardized protocol that ensures atomicity across distributed transactions. It involves a Prepare phase (voting) and a Commit phase. It is blocking and can reduce performance."

                    "answer": "In Orchestration, a central controller (the conductor) tells the participants what to do. In Choreography, each service subscribes to events and reacts independently without a central coordinator."
